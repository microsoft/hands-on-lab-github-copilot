# Creating a New Sample Spring Boot Application

In this section, we will create a sample Java project for testing GitHub Copilot in subsequent chapters. If you already have an existing Java project, feel free to skip this chapter and use your own project instead.  
  
## Creating a Spring Boot Application

```bash
> mkdir sample; cd sample
> curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
           -d dependencies=web,devtools \
           -d bootVersion=3.3.0 \
           -d type=maven-project \
           -d applicationName=CopilotSample \
           -d packageName=com.microsoft.sample \
           -d groupId=com.microsoft.sample \
           -d artifactId=CopilotSample \
           -d javaVersion=21 (or 17) \ 
           -o my-project.zip
> unzip my-project.zip
```

After unzipping the file, you will see the following directory structure:  

```bash

# Github Copilot for Java Development

## Checking if GitHub Copilot is Activated

The `GitHub Copilot Status Menu` icon is located at the bottom right of VS Code.  

![GitHub Copilot Status menu icon](assets/github-copilot-icon.png)

By clicking on this icon, you can check the status of GitHub Copilot. 
If it displays `Status: Ready` as shown below, GitHub Copilot is ready for use.  

![GitHub Copilot Enabled confirmation](assets/github-copilot-status.png)

If it does not display `Ready`, please return to the [Install Environment](/workshop/github-copilot-java/?step=1#install-extension-pack-for-github-copilot-tools-pack) section and set up your environment.  

## Basic Operations of GitHub Copilot

Here is a basic guide on how to use GitHub Copilot. It's not just about enabling the features of GitHub Copilot. By executing shortcut commands during program implementation, or changing the content of your comments, you can modify the suggested code. So, please try out these basic operations of GitHub Copilot yourself.  

### Code Suggestions and Explicit Triggers

Please open the `HelloRestController.java` file that you created in the previous chapter in your editor. There, by pressing the `Tab` key or entering a newline character, GitHub Copilot will start to suggest code for you.  

![First Trigger of GitHub Copilot](assets/github-copilot-first-trigger.png)

Alternatively, you can explicitly trigger it. If code suggestions are not being made, please enter the following shortcut key. This will execute the `editor.action.inlineSuggest.trigger` command and display the code that GitHub Copilot recommends.  

| OS      | Trigger Inline Suggestion |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| macOS   | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + \`   |
| Windows | `Alt + \`                 |

<div class="warning" data-title="warning">

> GitHub Copilot generates code predictions based on the environment it is being used in, so the content displayed may vary depending on the environment.

</div>

### Accepting Code Suggestions

When a code suggestion is displayed, you can confirm it by pressing the `Tab` key.

If you do not want to accept all the suggestions that Copilot displays and only wish to adopt parts of it, you can do so by pressing the `Command(Ctrl) + Right Arrow` key instead of the `Tab` key. This allows you to adopt suggestions word by word.

| OS      | Determin the proposal   |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| macOS   | `Command + right arrow` |
| Windows | `Ctrl + right arrow`    |

### Displaying Alternate Suggestions (Functionality may slightly vary depending on the environment)

There may be instances where the source code suggestions given by GitHub Copilot do not match the code you want to implement. In such cases, you can also display alternative suggestions for the initial code displayed. To show alternate suggestions, please press the following shortcut key.  

| OS      | See next suggestion     | See previous suggestion |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| macOS   | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + ]` | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + [` |
| Windows | `Alt + \`               | `Alt + [`               |

When you press the shortcut key, it will be displayed as follows.

![Alternative Code 1](assets/github-copilot-altenative-code-1.png)

If you press the shortcut key again, a different code will be output from the one above.

![Alternative Code 2](assets/github-copilot-altenative-code-2.png)

### Displaying List of Alternate Suggestions (Functionality may slightly vary depending on the environment)

Furthermore, if you are using Visual Studio Code, pressing the following shortcut key will display up to 10 alternative suggestions.  

| OS             | Next 10 suggestion |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| macOS, Windows | `Ctrl + Enter`     |

![Alternative Code 3](assets/github-copilot-altenative-lists.png)

As shown above, not only by simply enabling the GitHub Copilot feature, but also by executing shortcut commands during program implementation, you can display and apply a list of alternative candidates. By all means, please learn the basic operations of GitHub Copilot and give it a try.  

## Using GitHub Copilot in Java Application Development

### Points where GitHub Copilot can be used during Java application development

You can use GitHub Copilot in various scenarios during the development of Java applications.

- Creating source code
- Creating Markdown/HTML documents
- Editing Java property files

#### Creating Source Code  

As demonstrated in the basic operations above, GitHub Copilot provides various hints during the implementation of source code. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can further enhance your development productivity by utilizing GitHub Copilot Chat.  

#### Creating Markdown/HTML Documents

When creating documents for your project, you'll likely write them in Markdown. GitHub Copilot can also assist in creating Markdown documents. Open a Markdown file, click on the GitHub Copilot Status Menu icon, and select `Enable Completion for markdown`.

![Enable Completion for Markdown](assets/github-copilot-enable-completion-for-markdown.png)

Once enabled, it will provide various hints while you're writing your Markdown document. 
For example, if you input `#`, it will prompt you to enter a string following the `#`, and it can even predict what to write next based on the context of your document.  

![Enable Completion for Markdown 2](assets/github-copilot-enable-completion-for-markdown-2.png)

You can also use GitHub Copilot when writing HTML documents.  

#### Editing Java Property Files  

Additionally, GitHub Copilot can be used when editing Java property files. Properties are set according to the libraries you use, but it can be challenging to remember all the properties. In such cases, when you enter the property keyword, GitHub Copilot will display possible property candidates for you.  

![Enable Completion for Java Properties](assets/github-copilot-for-java-properties.png)

## Using GitHub Copilot in Java Source Code Implementation

Let's look at a few specific ways to utilize GitHub Copilot when editing Java source code.  

### Creating Sample Dummy Data  

When implementing a program, you may need to create sample data and test it locally. 
In such cases, GitHub Copilot can help you create sample data easily. For example, if you want to create sample data for stock ticker symbols, GitHub Copilot can generate a list of sample stock symbols for you.  

```text
// Create 20 sample data of Stock Tickers in List<String>  
```

The list of stock symbols created by GitHub Copilot looks like the following.

![Java Coding Sample 1](assets/java-implementation-sample1.png)

Similarly, if you want to create sample data for male names, GitHub Copilot can generate a list of sample male names for you.  

```text
// Create 20 sample data of American men's names in List<String>  
```

The list of name of male by GitHub Copilot looks like the following.

![Java Coding Sample 2](assets/java-implementation-sample2.png)

### Implementing Check Methods and Utility Methods  

Furthermore, GitHub Copilot can be used in various places during the implementation of a Java program. For example, you might implement check methods or utility methods in Java. In such cases, by writing comments, GitHub Copilot will propose the code for you.  

#### Checking the Format of Email Addresses 

For instance, when implementing a method to determine whether the format of an email address is correct, you would write a comment as shown below.  

```text
/**
 * Determine whether the string specified as an argument is  
 * in the format of a valid email address
 *
 * @param email
 * @return true if the string is a valid email address, false otherwise
*/
```

The actual outputted code looks like the following.  

![Java Coding Sample 3](assets/java-implementation-sample3.png)

The above regular expression `^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$` is used to validate the format of a typical email address. However, it does not cover some specific cases:  

1. The last part of the domain name (TLD, Top Level Domain) is limited to a range of 2 to 4 characters. However, nowadays there are TLDs with more than 4 characters, such as .info, .museum.  
2. The username part does not allow special characters (for example + or =). However, these characters are allowed in some email systems.  

Validating a complete email address is very complex, and regular expressions according to RFC 5322 can be very long and complex. However, for common cases, you can use the simplified regular expression below. If you modify the following code, it allows any alphabetic character of 2 or more characters (e.g. .museum). Also, dot (.) notation is allowed in the username part.  

```java
String emailRegex = "^[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)*@[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)*(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})$";
Pattern pat = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);
return email != null && pat.matcher(email).matches();
```

<div class="warning" data-title="warning">

> The code proposed by GitHub Copilot is not always correct. The output code may need to be modified. Please understand the output code and make corrections as necessary.  

</div>

#### Leap Year Determination Check  

Next, we will implement a method for checking leap year determination. Please write a comment as shown below:  

```text
/**
 * Determine whether the specified year in the argument is a leap year
 *
 * @param year
 * @return true if the year is a leap year, false otherwise  
*/
```

When you write a comment, the code will be output as shown below.

![Java Coding Sample 4](assets/java-implementation-sample4.png)

Of course, with the above code, you can determine a `leap year`, but by using the switch expression added in Java 14, you can implement it more concisely. To write using the switch expression added in Java 14, modify the comment as shown below.  

```text
/**
* Determine whether the year specified by the argument is a leap year  
* The implementation will use the switch expression introduced in Java 14  
*
* @param year
* @return true if the string is leap year, false otherwise
*/
```

![Java Coding Sample 5](assets/java-implementation-sample5.png)

<div class="info" data-title="info">

> The code output will change depending on the comments you write. In some cases, code using older Java language specifications or old libraries may be used. In such cases, by specifically instructing the code you want to write, it will be output as instructed.  

</div>

#### Display Files and Directories Under the Specified Directory  

Next, we will implement a method to display the files and directories that exist under the directory specified in the argument. Write a comment as shown below:  

```
// Show all files and directories recursively under the directory specified by the argument  
```

Then, a code like the one below will be suggested.

![Modernize Java Coding Style 2](assets/modernize-java-code-sample2.png)

The above code will work without any problems, but using Java NIO.2 or Stream API allows for a more concise description. To write according to the new language specification, let's modify the comments. Write a comment as shown below.  

```js
/**
 * In accordance with the Java 17 language specifications, 
 * using features like NIO.2, Stream API, Files.walk,
 * to recursively show the files and directories 
 * that exist under the specified directory.  
 *
 * @param directoryName
 */
```

As a result, a modern code like the one below has been output.

<div class="info" data-title="info">

> Currently, GitHub Copilot Chat does not offer a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to use GitHub Copilot Chat with Visual Studio Code.  
</div>

## About GitHub Copilot Chat  

Similar to GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot Chat provides AI-powered code completion. However, it goes beyond code completion by answering questions about code, offering explanations, and suggesting code modifications, thereby enhancing code quality.  

Here are some scenarios where GitHub Copilot Chat can be applied in Java application development:  

- Code generation
- Code explanation
- Code correction
- Answering coding-related questions
- Creating unit tests
- Explaining the error
- Fixing the error

## How to Use GitHub Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot can be used in two ways:  

* Through the dedicated GitHub Copilot chat window  
* Inline on the editor  

### Using the dedicated GitHub Copilot chat window  

Click on the GitHub Copilot icon in the lower left of VS Code to display the GitHub Copilot chat window.  

#### Slash Commands

To help Copilot provide more relevant answers, you can specify a topic for your questions using `slash commands`. Prepend your chat inputs with a specific topic name to guide Copilot towards a more relevant response. When you start typing `/`, a list of possible topics will appear:  

- **/api**: Ask about VS Code extension development.  
- **/explain**: Request a step-by-step explanation of the selected code.  
- **/fix**: Propose a fix for bugs in the selected code.  
- **/new**: Scaffold code for a new workspace. (e.g., /new spring boot)  
- **/newNotebook**: Create a new Jupyter Notebook. (Not available for Java)  
- **/terminal**: Ask how to perform tasks in the terminal.  
- **/tests**: Generate unit tests for the selected code.  
- **/vscode**: Ask about VS Code commands and settings.  
- **/help**: Get general help about GitHub Copilot.  
- **/clear**: Clear the session.

#### Chat View

The chat view offers a full chat experience, integrating seamlessly with your IDE. Once the view is open, you can start chatting with Copilot as your personal code coach. It keeps a history of the conversation and provides suggestions for questions along the way. You can:  

- Ask general questions about coding in any language or best practices  
- Request code generation or fixes related to the current file and inject the code directly into the file  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Windows](./assets/github-copilot-chat-start1.png)

### Using GitHub Copilot Chat Inline on the Editor

By pressing `Command + i` (or `Ctrl + Shift + i`) on the editor, an inline command window for Copilot Chat will appear within the editor.  
   
In inline mode, you can:  
   
- Request code explanations: This helps you understand what the code does and how it works.  
- Generate test code: This confirms that the code is working as expected.  
- Request code modifications: If there's a problem with the selected code, you can request a modification.  
- Generate new code: You can generate code for new features, classes, functions, etc.  

These requests are based on the selected code or the cursor's position. Also, these requests can be made by starting an inline chat session.  

![GitHub Copilot Inline windows1](./assets/github-copilot-chat-start2.png)

Additionally, typing `/` will display the commands that can be executed in GitHub Copilot Chat.  

![GitHub Copilot Inline windows2](./assets/github-copilot-chat-start3.png)

## Code generation

GitHub Copilot Chat can generate code for you.

### Create CRUD Operation for Spring Boot Application  

When creating a web application, you might need to create an application that performs CRUD operations. This requires implementing the web frontend, backend processing, and configuring property files. In such cases, if you enter a comment like the one below into GitHub Copilot Chat, it will suggest an implementation for a CRUD application.  

```text
> Create a sample application that performs CRUD operations to manage  
  people (name, id, e-mail, address) in Spring Boot.  
  The data should be persisted to the DB, and the database operations  
  should be implemented in Spring Data JPA.  
  The front should be implemented in Thymeleaf.  
  Please show all implementation of classes and methods and  
  application property configuration file.  
```

Then, the code suggested by GitHub Copilot will be displayed.

</video>

### Create a new Server-Sent Events endpoint with Spring Boot

While implementing, you may sometimes forget how to implement a method in Java. In such cases, you can ask to generate code by specifying the implementation method using a particular technology. For example, if you forget how to implement using Server-Sent Events in Spring Boot, enter a comment like the one below in GitHub Copilot Chat.  

```text
> Create sample code that periodically sends back data in a Server-Sent Events  
  to a user who connects to the Spring Boot REST endpoint. 
```

If you write a comment like this, explanations and code will be generated.  

![GitHub Copilot Saple 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-chat-sample1.png)

And it also shows the sample Java code.  

![GitHub Copilot Saple 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-chat-sample2.png)

## Code Explanation

Next, to understand the contents of the Java source code currently open in VS Code, you can get an explanation of the source code. GitHub Copilot Chat has prearranged commands for elucidating source code. Therefore, you can display the explanations by using these commands. First, input `/` in the console of GitHub Copilot Chat. Then, the commands that are available in GitHub Copilot Chat will appear.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Explain 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Code-Explain-1.png)

At this point, select `/explain`. It will appear as shown. Press the enter key to proceed.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Explain 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Code-Explain-2.png)

For example, select the following Java source code and execute the command.

![GitHub Copilot Chat Explain 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-explanation-code.png)

Then, an explanation of the Java source code will be provided.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Explain 3](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Code-Explain-3.png)

### Code Correction

GitHub Copilot can be used for code modification. For example, in a Java application that was implemented in the past, if there is code that was implemented with an old language specification version, you can modify that code to match the latest language specifications.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Modify the Code 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-modify-the-code-1.png)

For example, enter content like the following into the GitHub Copilot Chat prompt.  

```test
> Follow the latest Java 17 language specification and modify your code  
  to use NIO.2 or the Stream API. Use var to define variables  
```

Then, it will suggest Java code that conforms to the latest language specifications.

![GitHub Copilot Chat Modify the Code 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-modify-the-code-2.png)

When you move the mouse cursor to the top of the window with the suggested code, a menu will appear.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Modify the Code 3](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-modify-the-code-3.png)

You can perform the following actions:  

- `Copy` : Copy the code to the clipboard  
- `Insert at Cursor [^Enter]` : Insert the code at the cursor position  
- `Insert into New File` : Insert the code into a new file  
- `Run in Terminal` :  Execute the code (This function cannot be used in Java as you cannot directly execute the code)  

By performing the above `Copy` and Paste or `Insert at Cursor [^Enter]`, you can modify the old Java code to be compliant with the latest language specifications.  

## Answering Coding-Related Questions

Using GitHub Copilot Chat, you can get answers to questions about Java implementation.  

- Questions about the language specifications of the programming language  
- Questions about the Java runtime environment  
- Questions about library migration  
- Questions about how to use a specific library  

### Questions about the language specifications of the programming language

When you are programming in Java, there may be times when you want to know more about the language specifications of Java. In such cases, you can ask various questions to GitHub Copilot Chat.  

For example, if you want to know about the language specifications of Java 17, you can ask as follows:  

If you want to know about the language specifications added from Java 11 to Java 17, you can ask as follows.  

```text
> What language specifications have been added from  
  Java 11 to Java 17? In particular,  
  please provide detailed information about the new writing style  
  with sample code.  
```

### Questions about the Java runtime environment

There may be times when you want to understand points of caution in development environments, runtime environments, and production environments.   
In such cases, you can also ask questions about points that should be noted.  

```text
> Please explain the differences in Java VM startup options 
  and VM behavior between Java 11 and 17.
```

### Questions about library migration

Application development is not only about new development, but also about modernizing source code and migrating from other old frameworks. In such cases, you can inquire about points to note in modernization and specific procedures for migration.  

```text
> What should I keep in mind when migrating from a 2.7.x  
  project to 3.1.5 with Spring Boot?
```

### Questions about how to use a specific library

Also, when using a specific library for the first time, you may want to know how to use that library. In such cases, you can ask about how to use the library.  

```text
> Please explain the implementation code for asynchronous  
  processing using Mono and Flux of Project Reactor  
  in an easy-to-understand manner with sample code.
```

### Points to Note about GitHub Copilot Chat Questions and Answers

One thing to note when using GitHub Copilot Chat is that not all inquiries will return the correct answer. For example, in the author's environment, the following inquiry did not return the correct answer.  

```text
> Please explain the details of JEP 450
```

As a result of the inquiry, the following result was returned.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Mistake 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-ask-mistake-1.png)

However, the actual JEP 450 is [JEP 450: Compact Object Headers (Experimental)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/450), and it is not a JEP related to Unicode 14 as mentioned above.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Mistake 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-ask-mistake-2.png)

The proposed contents by GitHub Copilot Chat are not always correct. Please understand the proposed contents and make corrections as necessary.

### Other Inquiry Examples

## Creating Unit Tests

GitHub Copilot Chat can also generate unit tests for you.  

### Create a Unit Test for Spring Boot Application

When implementing a Spring Boot application, you may want to create a unit test for the application.  
In such cases, you can select the class or method you want to test and ask GitHub Copilot Chat to create a unit test for you.  
For example, if you want to create a unit test for the `ProductController` class, you can select the code and ask GitHub Copilot Chat to create a unit test for you.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Generate Test Res 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Test-Generate-Res-1.png)

After selecting the code, type `/tests` and press `Enter` in GitHub Copilot Chat.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Generate Test 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Generate-Test1.png)

Then, an explanation and the Unit Test code will be generated.

![GitHub Copilot Chat Generate Test Res 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Test-Generate-Res-2.png)

## Explaining Errors and Fixing Them  

In Java application development, there may be times when errors occur at compile time or runtime. In such cases, you can ask GitHub Copilot Chat about the content of the error, and it will explain the error to you.  

For example, when running a Java application, an exception may occur, and at first glance, the content of the error may be hard to understand. However, by asking GitHub Copilot Chat about the error, it will explain the content of the error to you.  

```text
> When running the application, the following exception was output.   
  What does the following mean?  

### Exception
Copy & Paste the Java Stack Trace
###
```

Furthermore, you can even inquire about how to deal with the problem that occurred.  

```text
> How can I solve the above issues?  
 
> Can you propose a fix?  

> To solve the issue, please let me know   
  how to implement *** with sample code.  
```

When you inquire about an actual exception that occurred and ask for how to deal with it, you will receive an answer as shown below.

# More Prompt engineering in GitHub Copilot

In this section you will learn techniques to get more accurate results using prompt engineering techniques.

**What is prompt engineering?**

Prompt engineering is the process of designing high quality prompts to generate high quality code suggestions. There are good practices and tips to write better prompts. Let's see some of them.

## Provide examples: one-shot and few-shots programming

Talking about prompt engineering, you can also use the chat to provide examples to Copilot. It's a good way to help Copilot understand what you want to do and generate better code. You can provide examples in the chat by typing with the validator.ts file open:

```bash
# one-shot programming

Write me unit tests for phone number validators methods using mocha and chai in the current file.
Use the following examples for positive test (test that should return true): 
it('should return true if the phone number is a valid international number', () => { expect(validatePhoneNumber('+33606060606')).to.be.true; });
Organize test in logic suites and generate at least 4 positives tests and 2 negatives tests for each method.
```

```bash
# few-shot programming

Write me unit tests for all validators methods using mocha and chai in the current file.
Use the following examples for positive test (test that should return true): 
it('should return true if the phone number is a valid international number', () => { expect(validatePhoneNumber('+33606060606')).to.be.true; });
it('should return true if the phone number is a valid local american number', () => { expect(validatePhoneNumber('202-939-9889')).to.be.true; });
it('should throw an error if the given phone number is empty', () => { expect(validatePhoneNumber('')).to.throw(); });
Organize test in logic suites and generate at least 4 positives tests and 2 negatives tests for each method.
```

You can use this technique to **generate code that keeps the styling code from another file**. For example if you want to create sample records for music style like the Albums in albums-api>Models>Album.cs file, open it and type:

```bash
Write a MusicStyle record that conatins a List<MusicStyle> with 6 sample values like in the Album.cs file.
```

## Provide external references

The chat copilot can use external references to build more accurate suggestions. For exemple if you want to generate a code that make a request to an API you can provide an example of the API response in the chat or the url to the API reference. Copilot will use it to generate better code.

```bash
Write a TS function that retreiev all dog breeds from the following API and return an array of Breed objects Request: HTTP GET https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
```

Copilot will use the given external reference to generate the code. You will see that he wil generate the Breef interface (or class) with a subBreeds property. It's coming from the API given by the external reference.

```ts
interface Breed {
  name: string;
  subBreeds: string[];
}
```

<div class="tips" data-title="tip">

> You can also provide links to external documentations like SDK, libraries, etc... or event normative documents like RFCs, etc...

</div>

## Role Prompting

Also called foundational prompt, it's a general prompt you're giving to Copilot Chat to personnalise his behavior and setup your flavour of Copilot.

This is probably the first thing to do when you start a new task with Copilot Chat: **provide a clear description of what you want to build and how do you want copilot to help you**.

<div class="warning" data-title="Important">

> **This is very powerfull when handled properly** so be sure to start every coding sessions with a role prompt and save your best prompt for future use.

</div>

***Structure of a role prompt***

What can you include in a role prompt:

- Provide solid context and background information on what you want to build.
- Define GitHub Copilotâ€™s role and setting expectations about what feedback we are looking for.
- Be specific in the quality of answers and ask for reference and additional resources to learn more and ensure the answers you receive are correct
- Resume the task and ask if the instructions are clear

***Example of a role prompt***

Start a new conversation and type the following prompt:

```bash
I'm working on a new mobile application that is built on React Native. 
I need to build a new feature that will allow the user to upload a picture of a dog and get the breed of the dog. 
I will need to use the following set of APIs to work on the breeds: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds. I need to be sure that my code is secured againt at least the OWASP Top 10 treats (https://owasp.org/Top10/). 
I need to have unit tests for the code and i want my application to be fully accessible and conforms with the WCAG 2.1 level A and AA success criteria defined at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/.
I need you to act as my own code coach to ensure that my code fits all these requirements. 
When possible, please provide links and references for additional learning. 
Do you understand these instructions? 
```

From there you can start asking questions and from time to time, ensure Copilot still follows the instructions by asking:

```bash
Are you still using the instructions I provided?
```

***Test your role prompt***

You can test your role prompt by asking questions about best practices for accessibility on React Native Apps and OWASP Top 10 treats. You can also ask to generate code for the upload feature and check if the generated code is secured and accessible.

Try these questions for example:

```bash
how can i make my app accessible with react native?

what is the most secure way to upload a photo from my app?
```

## Big Prompts and Short Prompts

Copilot will probably will always more effective with prompt to generate small but precisely described pieces of code rather than a whole class with a unique multiple lines prompt.

<div class="tip" data-title="tip">

> The best strategy to generate big piece of code, is starting by the basic shell of your code with a simple prompt and then adding small pieces one by one.

</div>

## Writing CI pipelines

*Copilot will help you in writing your pipeline definition files to generate the code for the different steps and tasks. Here are some examples of what it can do:*

- *generate a pipeline definition file `from scratch`*
- *accelerate the writing of a pipeline definition file by `generating the code` for the different `steps, tasks and pieces of script`*
- *help `discover marketplace tasks and extensions` that match your need*

### Step 1: generate from scratch

- Create a new file `pipeline.yml` in the `.github/workflows` folder of the project and start typing the following prompt:

```yml
# Github Action pipeline that runs on push to main branch
# Docker build and push the album-api image to ACR
```

*Copilot will generate the pipeline block by block. Generation pipelines Yaml, you will sometimes need to jump to a new line to trigger the generation of the next block more often than with other type of code.*

*It will often generate a task with a few errores coming from bad indentation or missing quote around a task name. You can easily fix these with your IDE and your developer skills :)*

### Step 2: add tasks from prompts

- You probably have a github action workflow with at least a "login" task to your container registry and a "docker build and deploy" task. Add a new comment after those tasks to tag the docker image with the github run id and push it to the registry:

```yml
# tag the image with the github run id and push to docker hub
```

you can play with other prompts like:

```yml
# run tests on the album-api image

# deploy the album-api image to the dev AKS cluster
```

### Step 3: add scripts from prompts

- Copilot is also very usefull when you need to write custom script like the following example:

```yml
# find and replace the %%VERSION%% by the github action run id in every appmanifest.yml file
```

## Infra As Code

Copilot can also help you write Infrastructure as code. It can generate code for `Terraform, ARM, Bicep, Pulumi, etc...` and also `Kubernetes manifest files`.

### Bicep

Open the `main.bicep`file in `iac/bicep` folder and start typing prompts at the end of the file to add new resources:

```js
// Container Registry

// Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision resource
```

### Terraform

Open the `app.tf`file in `iac/terraform` folder and start typing prompts at the end of the file to add new resources:

```yml
# Container Registry

# Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision resource
```

## Generate Git Commit comment

Yes, writing a comment should be mandatory and developers tend to be lazy. GitHub Copilot can help with that.

1. Just edit any file by adding some relevant content into it.

2. On the Git commit panel, click the small magical button on the right

    ![GitHub Copilot Git comment generator](assets/git-commit.png)

3. Admire Copilot having generated a comment for you
