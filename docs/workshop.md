## Avoid using publicly published code

If you set up a Copilot Business subscription for your organization, you can configure GitHub Copilot settings for your organization.  

For instance, if you're coding in a corporate environment, you might not want to use publicly available code due to enterprise rules or code licensing. In such cases, you can configure GitHub Copilot Chat to avoid using publicly published code.  

To do this, you need to set up a [Settings Copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot) for your organization.  

![GitHub Copilot Rejected Prompt](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Blocked-Public.png)

Once these settings are in place, GitHub Copilot Chat will not use public code. If GitHub Copilot Chat attempts to use public code after entering a prompt, it will display a message and stop processing.

# App setup

In this section, we will create a sample Java project for testing GitHub Copilot in subsequent chapters.  
  
## Creating a Spring Boot Sample Application

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

```bash
mkdir sample; cd sample
iwr -OutFile starter.zip "https://start.spring.io/starter.zip?dependencies=web,devtools&applicationName=CopilotSample&packageName=com.microsoft.sample&groupId=com.microsoft.sample&artifactId=CopilotSample&javaVersion=21&type=maven-project"

explorer .
```
Then, extract the `starter.zip` archive
</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

```bash
mkdir sample; cd sample
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=web,devtools -d bootVersion=3.3.0 -d type=maven-project -d applicationName=CopilotSample -d packageName=com.microsoft.sample -d groupId=com.microsoft.sample -d artifactId=CopilotSample -d javaVersion=21 -o my-project.zip
unzip my-project.zip
```
</details>

After unzipping the file, you will see the following directory structure:  

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ HELP.md
â”œâ”€â”€ mvnw
â”œâ”€â”€ mvnw.cmd

## Basic Operations of GitHub Copilot

<div class="important" data-title="important">

> **Note for IntelliJ users**: This workshop is primarily designed with VS Code in mind. That being said, everything covered in this workshop can also be done in the IntelliJ suite. However, please note that in IntelliJ IDEs, some features presented here have **no shortcut assigned by default**. You can assign them in IntelliJ IDEAâ€™s settings by clicking on the GitHub Copilot shortcut and selecting `Map keyboard shortcuts.`
Then, search for `Copilot` to find all available shortcuts.
You can find all the shortcuts in the [**GitHub Copilot documentation**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-code-suggestions-in-your-ide-with-github-copilot?tool=jetbrains).

</div>

Here is a basic guide on how to use GitHub Copilot. It's not just about enabling the features of GitHub Copilot. By executing shortcut commands during program implementation, or changing the content of your comments, you can modify the suggested code. So, please try out these basic operations of GitHub Copilot yourself.  


### Code suggestions and explicit triggers

Please open the `HelloRestController.java` file that you created in the previous chapter in your editor. There, by pressing the `Tab` key or entering a newline character, GitHub Copilot will start to suggest code for you.  

![First Trigger of GitHub Copilot](assets/github-copilot-first-trigger.png)

Alternatively, you can explicitly trigger it using a shortcut. This shortcut should be the same on IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code.

  | OS      | Trigger Inline Suggestion |
  | ------- | ------------------------- |
  | macOS   | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + \`   |
  | Windows | `Alt + \`                 |

<div class="tip" data-title="IntellJ">

> If the shortcut is not defined, you can remap the shortcut associated to `Copilot: Show Completions` in IntellJ settings.

</div>

<div class="warning" data-title="warning">

> GitHub Copilot generates code predictions based on the environment it is being used in, so the content displayed may vary depending on your environment.

</div>

### Accepting Code Suggestions

When a code suggestion is displayed, you can confirm it by pressing the `Tab` key.

If you do not want to accept all the suggestions that Copilot displays and only wish to adopt parts of it, you can do so by pressing the `Command(Ctrl) + Right Arrow` key instead of the `Tab` key. This allows you to adopt suggestions word by word.

| OS      | Determin the proposal   |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| macOS   | `Command + right arrow` |
| Windows | `Ctrl + right arrow`    |

<div class="tip" data-title="IntellJ">

> If the shortcut is not defined, you can remap the shortcut associated to `Copilot: Apply Next Word of Completion to Editor` in IntellJ settings.

</div>

### Displaying alternate suggestions

There may be instances where the source code suggestions given by GitHub Copilot do not match the code you want to implement. In such cases, you can also display alternative suggestions for the initial code displayed. To show alternate suggestions, please press the following shortcut key.  

| OS      | See next suggestion     | See previous suggestion |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| macOS   | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + ]` | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + [` |
| Windows | `Alt + \`               | `Alt + [`               |

<div class="tip" data-title="IntellJ">

> If the shortcut is not defined, you can remap the shortcuts associated to `Copilot: Show Next Completions` and `Copilot: Show Previous Completions` in IntellJ settings.

</div>

When you press the shortcut key, it will be displayed as follows.

![Alternative Code 1](assets/github-copilot-altenative-code-1.png)

If you press the shortcut key again, a different code will be output from the one above.

![Alternative Code 2](assets/github-copilot-altenative-code-2.png)

### Displaying list of alternate suggestions

Furthermore, if you are using Visual Studio Code, pressing the following shortcut key will display up to 10 alternative suggestions.  

| OS             | Next 10 suggestion |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| macOS, Windows | `Ctrl + Enter`     |

<div class="tip" data-title="IntellJ">

> This shortcut for this feature should be the same in recent versions of IntelliJ IDEA, but will instead open a new tab with the suggestions.
Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-code-suggestions-in-your-ide-with-github-copilot?tool=jetbrains#showing-alternative-suggestions) for more information.

</div>

![Alternative Code 3](assets/github-copilot-altenative-lists.png)

As shown above, not only by simply enabling the GitHub Copilot feature, but also by executing shortcut commands during program implementation, you can display and apply a list of alternative candidates.

## Inside your Java applications

GitHub Copilot is not language-specific and is not even restricted to programming languages. Configuration files and documentation can also benefit from its completion capabilities. This means you can use GitHub Copilot in various scenarios during the development of Java applications such as: 

- Creating source code
- Creating Markdown/HTML documents
- Editing Java property files

### Creating Source Code  

As demonstrated in the basic operations above, GitHub Copilot provides various hints during the implementation of source code. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can further enhance your development productivity by utilizing GitHub Copilot Chat.  

### Creating Markdown/HTML documents

When creating documents for your project, you'll likely write them in Markdown. GitHub Copilot can also assist in creating Markdown documents. Open the Markdown file called `HELP.md` inside the Java project created during the Environment Setup Step, click on the GitHub Copilot Menu icon, `Configure Code Completion` then select `Edit Settings`.

You can then set completion for Markdown to true as shown bellow.

![Enable Completion for Markdown](assets/github-copilot-enable-completion-for-markdown.png)

Once enabled, it will provide various hints while you're writing your Markdown document. 
For example, if you input `#`, it will prompt you to enter a string following the `#`, and it can even predict what to write next based on the context of your document.  

![Enable Completion for Markdown 2](assets/github-copilot-enable-completion-for-markdown-2.png)

You can also use GitHub Copilot when writing HTML documents.  

### Editing Java property files  

Additionally, GitHub Copilot can be used when editing Java property files. Properties are set according to the libraries you use, but it can be challenging to remember all the properties. In such cases, when you enter the property keyword, GitHub Copilot will display possible property candidates for you. 

You can open the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` folder and enter the following comment. 

```text
# Logging settings
```

This will prompt you to enter the logging settings:

![Enable Completion for Java Properties](assets/github-copilot-for-java-properties.png)

### Creating sample dummy data  

When implementing a program, you may need to create sample data and test it locally. 
In such cases, GitHub Copilot can help you create sample data easily. For example, if you want to create sample data for stock ticker symbols, GitHub Copilot can generate a list of sample stock symbols for you.  

Open the `HelloRestController.java` file and enter the following comment.

```text
// Create 20 sample data of Stock Tickers in List<String>  
```

The list of stock symbols created by GitHub Copilot looks like the following.

![Java Coding Sample 1](assets/java-implementation-sample1.png)

Don't hesitate to look at the different suggestions and choose the one that best fits your needs using the `Crtl + Enter` command.

Similarly, if you want to create sample data for male names, GitHub Copilot can generate a list of sample male names for you.  

```text
// Create 20 sample data of American men's names in List<String>  
```

The list of name of male by GitHub Copilot looks like the following.

![Java Coding Sample 2](assets/java-implementation-sample2.png)

You will probably noticed that when you choose a specific style of implementation, GitHub Copilot will suggest similar code in the future. This is because it learns from your coding style and preferences.

### Implementing check methods and utility methods  

Furthermore, GitHub Copilot can be used in various places during the implementation of a Java program. For example, you might implement check methods or utility methods in Java. In such cases, by writing comments, GitHub Copilot will propose the code for you.  

#### Checking the format of email addresses 

For instance, when implementing a method to determine whether the format of an email address is correct, you would write a comment as shown below.  

```text
/**
 * Determine whether the string specified as an argument is  
 * in the format of a valid email address
 *
 * @param email
 * @return true if the string is a valid email address, false otherwise
*/
```

The actual outputted code looks like the following.  

![Java Coding Sample 3](assets/java-implementation-sample3.png)

The above regular expression `^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$` is used to validate the format of a typical email address. However, it does not cover some specific cases:  

1. The last part of the domain name (TLD, Top Level Domain) is limited to a range of 2 to 4 characters. However, nowadays there are TLDs with more than 4 characters, such as .info, .museum.  
2. The username part does not allow special characters (for example + or =). However, these characters are allowed in some email systems.  

Validating a complete email address is very complex, and regular expressions according to RFC 5322 can be very long and complex. However, for common cases, you can use the simplified regular expression below. If you modify the following code, it allows any alphabetic character of 2 or more characters (e.g. .museum). Also, dot (.) notation is allowed in the username part.  

```java
String emailRegex = "^[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)*@[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)*(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})$";
Pattern pat = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);
return email != null && pat.matcher(email).matches();
```

#### Leap year determination check  

Next, we will implement a method for checking leap year determination. Please write a comment as shown below:  

```text
/**
 * Determine whether the specified year in the argument is a leap year
 *
 * @param year
 * @return true if the year is a leap year, false otherwise  
*/
```

When you write a comment, the code will be output as shown below.

![Java Coding Sample 4](assets/java-implementation-sample4.png)

Of course, with the above code, you can determine a `leap year`, but by using the switch expression added in Java 14, you can implement it more concisely. To write using the switch expression added in Java 14, modify the comment as shown below.  

```text
/**
* Determine whether the year specified by the argument is a leap year  
* The implementation will use the switch expression introduced in Java 14  
*
* @param year
* @return true if the string is leap year, false otherwise
*/
```

![Java Coding Sample 5](assets/java-implementation-sample5.png)

<div class="info" data-title="info">

> The code output will change depending on the comments you write. In some cases, code using older Java language specifications or old libraries may be used. In such cases, by specifically instructing the code you want to write, it will be output as instructed.  

</div>

#### Display files and directories under the specified directory  

Next, we will implement a method to display the files and directories that exist under the directory specified in the argument. Write a comment as shown below:  

```
// Show all files and directories recursively under the directory specified by the argument  
```

Then, a code like the one below will be suggested.

![Modernize Java Coding Style 2](assets/modernize-java-code-sample2.png)

The above code will work without any problems, but using Java NIO.2 or Stream API allows for a more concise description. To write according to the new language specification, let's modify the comments. Write a comment as shown below.  

```js
/**
 * In accordance with the Java 17 language specifications, 
 * using features like NIO.2, Stream API, Files.walk,
 * to recursively show the files and directories 
 * that exist under the specified directory.  
 *
 * @param directoryName
 */
```

As a result, a modern code like the one below has been output.  

![Modernize Java Coding Style 1](assets/modernize-java-code-sample1.png)

<div class="info" data-title="info">

> Just like the leap year calculation mentioned above, rewriting the comments will prompt it to suggest code using new language specifications or new libraries.

Additionally, typing `/` will display the commands that can be executed in GitHub Copilot Chat.  

![GitHub Copilot Inline windows2](./assets/github-copilot-chat-start3.png)

## Code generation

GitHub Copilot Chat can generate code for you.

### Create CRUD operation for Spring Boot Application  

When creating a web application, you might need to create an application that performs CRUD operations. This requires implementing the web frontend, backend processing, and configuring property files. In such cases, if you enter a comment like the one below into GitHub Copilot Chat, it will suggest an implementation for a CRUD application.  

```text
Create a sample application that performs CRUD operations to manage  
people (name, id, e-mail, address) in Spring Boot.  
The data should be persisted to the DB, and the database operations  
should be implemented in Spring Data JPA.  
The front should be implemented in Thymeleaf.  
Please show all implementation of classes and methods and  
application property configuration file.  
```

Then, the code suggested by GitHub Copilot will be displayed.

### Create a new Server-Sent Events endpoint with Spring Boot

While implementing, you may sometimes forget how to implement a method in Java. In such cases, you can ask to generate code by specifying the implementation method using a particular technology. For example, if you forget how to implement using Server-Sent Events in Spring Boot, enter a comment like the one below in GitHub Copilot Chat.  

```text
Create sample code that periodically sends back data in a Server-Sent Events  
to a user who connects to the Spring Boot REST endpoint. 
```

If you write a comment like this, explanations and code will be generated.  

![GitHub Copilot Saple 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-chat-sample1.png)

And it also shows the sample Java code.  

![GitHub Copilot Saple 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-chat-sample2.png)

## Code explanation

Next, to understand the contents of the Java source code currently open in VS Code, you can get an explanation of the source code. GitHub Copilot Chat has prearranged commands for elucidating source code. Therefore, you can display the explanations by using these commands. First, input `/` in the console of GitHub Copilot Chat. Then, the commands that are available in GitHub Copilot Chat will appear.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Explain 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Code-Explain-1.png)

At this point, select `/explain`. It will appear as shown. Press the enter key to proceed.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Explain 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Code-Explain-2.png)

For example, select the following Java source code and execute the command.

```java
package com.microsoft.sample;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/products")
public class ProductController {

    // Simulated database
    private Map<Long, Product> productDatabase;

    public ProductController() {
        // Initialize the simulated database
        this.productDatabase = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Add some sample products
        productDatabase.put(1L, new Product(1L, "Laptop", 1299.99, "High performance laptop"));
        productDatabase.put(2L, new Product(2L, "Smartphone", 799.99, "Latest smartphone model"));
        productDatabase.put(3L, new Product(3L, "Headphones", 149.99, "Noise cancelling headphones"));
        productDatabase.put(4L, new Product(4L, "Tablet", 499.99, "10 inch tablet"));
        productDatabase.put(5L, new Product(5L, "Smart Watch", 299.99, "Fitness tracking smart watch"));
    }

    /**
     * Get all products
     * @return List of products
     */
    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<List<Product>> getAllProducts() {
        List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>(productDatabase.values());
        return ResponseEntity.ok(products);
    }

    /**
     * Get product by ID
     * @param id ID of the product to retrieve
     * @return The product if it exists
     */
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Product> getProductById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Product product = productDatabase.get(id);
        if (product == null) {
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
        return ResponseEntity.ok(product);
    }
}
```

Then, an explanation of the Java source code will be provided.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Explain 3](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Code-Explain-3.png)

## Code Correction

GitHub Copilot can be used for code modification. For example, in a Java application that was implemented in the past, if there is code that was implemented with an old language specification version, you can modify that code to match the latest language specifications.  

```java
private void showAllFiles(File dir) throw IOException {
    File[] files = dir.listFiles();
    if (files != null) {
        for (File file : files) {
            if (file.isDirectory()) {
                System.out.println("Directory: " + file.getCanonicalPath());
                showAllFiles(file);
            } else {
                System.out.println("File: " + file.getCanonicalPath());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For example, enter content like the following into the GitHub Copilot Chat prompt or by right-clicking on the code and selecting `Ask Copilot Chat`.  

```text
Follow the latest Java 17 language specification and modify your code to use NIO.2 or the Stream API. Use var to define variables  
```

Then, it will suggest Java code that conforms to the latest language specifications.

![GitHub Copilot Chat Modify the Code 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-modify-the-code-2.png)

If you are using GitHub Copilot Chat, when you move the mouse cursor to the top of the window with the suggested code, a menu will appear.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Modify the Code 3](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-modify-the-code-3.png)

You can perform the following actions:  

- `Copy` : Copy the code to the clipboard  
- `Insert at Cursor [^Enter]` : Insert the code at the cursor position  
- `Insert into New File` : Insert the code into a new file  
- `Run in Terminal` :  Execute the code (This function cannot be used in Java as you cannot directly execute the code)  

By performing the above `Copy` and Paste or `Insert at Cursor [^Enter]`, you can modify the old Java code to be compliant with the latest language specifications.  

## Answering Coding-Related Questions

Using GitHub Copilot Chat, you can get answers to questions about Java implementation.  

- Questions about the language specifications of the programming language

### Questions about the language specifications of the programming language

When you are programming in Java, there may be times when you want to know more about the language specifications of Java. In such cases, you can ask various questions to GitHub Copilot Chat.  

For example, if you want to know about the language specifications of Java 17, you can ask as follows:  

If you want to know about the language specifications added from Java 11 to Java 17, you can ask as follows.  

```text
> What language specifications have been added from  
  Java 11 to Java 17? In particular,  
  please provide detailed information about the new writing style  
  with sample code.  
```

### Questions about the Java runtime environment

There may be times when you want to understand points of caution in development environments, runtime environments, and production environments.   
In such cases, you can also ask questions about points that should be noted.  

```text
> Please explain the differences in Java VM startup options 
  and VM behavior between Java 11 and 17.
```

### Questions about library migration

Application development is not only about new development, but also about modernizing source code and migrating from other old frameworks. In such cases, you can inquire about points to note in modernization and specific procedures for migration.  

```text
> What should I keep in mind when migrating from a 2.7.x  
  project to 3.1.5 with Spring Boot?
```

### Points to Note about GitHub Copilot Chat Questions and Answers

One thing to note when using GitHub Copilot Chat is that not all inquiries will return the correct answer. For example, in the author's environment, the following inquiry did not return the correct answer.  

```text
> Please explain the details of JEP 450
```

As a result of the inquiry, the following result was returned.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Mistake 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-ask-mistake-1.png)

However, the actual JEP 450 is [JEP 450: Compact Object Headers (Experimental)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/450), and it is not a JEP related to Unicode 14 as mentioned above.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Mistake 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-ask-mistake-2.png)

The proposed contents by GitHub Copilot Chat are not always correct. Please understand the proposed contents and make corrections as necessary.

  in an easy-to-understand manner with sample code.  
```

## Creating Unit Tests

GitHub Copilot Chat can also generate unit tests for you.  

### Create a Unit Test for Spring Boot Application

When implementing a Spring Boot application, you may want to create a unit test for the application.  
In such cases, you can select the class or method you want to test and ask GitHub Copilot Chat to create a unit test for you.  
For example, if you want to create a unit test for the `ProductController` class, you can select the code and ask GitHub Copilot Chat to create a unit test for you.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Generate Test Res 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Test-Generate-Res-1.png)

After selecting the code, type `/tests` and press `Enter` in GitHub Copilot Chat.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Generate Test 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Generate-Test1.png)

Then, an explanation and the Unit Test code will be generated.

![GitHub Copilot Chat Generate Test Res 3](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Test-Generate-Res-3.png)
![GitHub Copilot Chat Generate Test Res 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Test-Generate-Res-2.png)

## Explaining Errors and Fixing Them  

In Java application development, there may be times when errors occur at compile time or runtime. In such cases, you can ask GitHub Copilot Chat about the content of the error, and it will explain the error to you.  

For example, when running a Java application, an exception may occur, and at first glance, the content of the error may be hard to understand. However, by asking GitHub Copilot Chat about the error, it will explain the content of the error to you.  

```text
> When running the application, the following exception was output.   
  What does the following mean?  

### Exception
Copy & Paste the Java Stack Trace
###
```

Furthermore, you can even inquire about how to deal with the problem that occurred.  

```text
> How can I solve the above issues?  
 
> Can you propose a fix?  

> To solve the issue, please let me know   
  how to implement *** with sample code.  
```

When you inquire about an actual exception that occurred and ask for how to deal with it, you will receive an answer as shown below.  

<video controls playsinline width="100%" autoplay loop muted="true" src="assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-fix-error.mp4" type="video/mp4" >

# More Prompt engineering in GitHub Copilot

In this section you will learn techniques to get more accurate results using prompt engineering techniques.

**What is prompt engineering?**

Prompt engineering is the process of designing high quality prompts to generate high quality code suggestions. There are good practices and tips to write better prompts. Let's see some of them.

## Provide examples: zero-shot, and few-shots programming

Talking about prompt engineering, you can also use the chat to provide examples to Copilot. It's a good way to help Copilot understand what you want to do and generate better code. You can use the following techniques to provide examples:

```bash
# zero-shot programming : 0 example provided
Write a function in Java that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum.
```

In few-shot prompting, you provide a few examples for Copilot to learn the pattern and generate better code based on those examples. This is useful when you want to guide the model toward a specific coding style or solve a problem in a certain way.

```bash
# few-shot programming : 3 examples provided
Write a function in Java that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum.
Example 1 : sum(new int[]{ 1,2,3 };) => 6
Example 2 : sum(new int[]{ 1,2,3,4 };) => 10
Example 3 : sum(new int[]{};) => 0
```

In this example, you provide a few examples to Copilot to learn the pattern and generate better code based on those examples.
Here's another example.
In a new java file, paste this code:

```java
public class Calculator {

    public static int add(int a, int b, int c){
        return a+ b;
    }

    public static int subtract(int a, int b, int c){
        return a - b;
    }
}
```

As you can see, in each method, the third parameter is unused.
Now, try to add a new method named multiply that has the same signature.

You should see that Copilot will generate a method with the same signature and the third parameter is unused.
![Copilot multiply method](assets/few-shots-multiply.png)

This is because Copilot learned from the examples you provided and generated a code that follows the pattern you provided.

## Chain of thought Prompting

In chain of thought prompting, you break down the problem into smaller steps to guide Copilot's reasoning, making it more likely to generate code that correctly solves the problem.
This is a technique useful in scenarios where you want to solve a complex problem or build a complex feature.

```bash
# In this example, we will guide Copilot to generate a code that calculates the factorial of a number.
// Write a function in Java that calculates the factorial of a number.

// Step 1: To calculate the factorial, we need to multiply the number by all positive integers less than it.
// Step 2: If the number is 0, the factorial is defined to be 1 (base case).
// Step 3: Otherwise, multiply the number by the factorial of the number minus 1 recursively.
```

You can test it by copying and pasting the following prompt in a file for Copilot to generate the code.

That being said, the factorial function is a classic example, and classic prompting will most likely generate the correct code. 

However, this technique is useful when you want to guide Copilot to generate code that follows a specific pattern or algorithm. Let's guide Copilot to generate a code that calculates the A* distance between two points.

```bash
# Chain of thought prompting for A* pathfinding algorithm:

Step 1: The A* algorithm requires a start and a goal node to find the best path. We will need to define the nodes on a grid, each with a position (x, y).

Step 2: For each node, we will calculate three values:
    - `g`: the cost of the path from the start node to this node.
    - `h`: the heuristic estimate of the cost from this node to the goal node.
    - `f`: the total estimated cost, calculated as `f = g + h`.

Step 3: The heuristic (`h`) will be the Manhattan distance (or another heuristic, like Euclidean) between the current node and the goal.

Step 4: We need to maintain two lists: `openList` (nodes to be evaluated) and `closedList` (nodes already evaluated).

Step 5: The algorithm selects the node with the lowest `f` value from `openList` and moves it to `closedList`. We evaluate its neighbors and update their `f` values accordingly.

Step 6: Repeat this process until the goal node is found or there are no more nodes to evaluate.

Step 7: Once the goal node is reached, reconstruct the path by tracing back from the goal node to the start node.

Now, let's write the A* pathfinding algorithm in Java.
```

Now, let's test it by copying and pasting the following prompt in the GitHub Copilot Chat. You should see that Copilot generates the code step by step following the instructions you provided with some explanations.

## Role Prompting

Also called foundational prompt, it's a general prompt you're giving to Copilot Chat to personnalise his behavior and setup your flavour of Copilot.

This is probably the first thing to do when you start a new task with Copilot Chat: **provide a clear description of what you want to build and how do you want copilot to help you**.

<div class="warning" data-title="Important">

> **This is very powerfull when handled properly** so be sure to start every coding sessions with a role prompt and save your best prompt for future use.

</div>

***Structure of a role prompt***

What can you include in a role prompt:

- Provide solid context and background information on what you want to build.
- Define GitHub Copilotâ€™s role and setting expectations about what feedback we are looking for.
- Be specific in the quality of answers and ask for reference and additional resources to learn more and ensure the answers you receive are correct
- Resume the task and ask if the instructions are clear

***Example of a role prompt***

Start a new GitHub Copilot Chat conversation and type the following prompt:

```bash
I'm working on a new mobile application that is built on React Native. 
I need to build a new feature that will allow the user to upload a picture of a dog and get the breed of the dog. 
I will need to use the following set of APIs to work on the breeds: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds. I need to be sure that my code is secured againt at least the OWASP Top 10 treats (https://owasp.org/Top10/). 
I need to have unit tests for the code and I want my application to be fully accessible and conforms with the WCAG 2.1 level A and AA success criteria defined at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/.
I need you to act as my own code coach to ensure that my code fits all these requirements. 
When possible, please provide links and references for additional learning. 
Do you understand these instructions? 
```

From there you can start asking questions and from time to time, ensure Copilot still follows the instructions by asking:

```bash
Are you still using the instructions I provided?
```

***Test your role prompt***

You can test your role prompt by asking questions about best practices for accessibility on React Native Apps and OWASP Top 10 treats. You can also ask to generate code for the upload feature and check if the generated code is secured and accessible.

Try these questions for example:

```bash
how can I make my app accessible with react native?

what is the most secure way to upload a photo from my app?
```

## Big Prompts and Short Prompts

Copilot will probably will always more effective with prompt to generate small but precisely described pieces of code rather than a whole class with a unique multiple lines prompt.

<div class="tip" data-title="tip">

> The best strategy to generate big piece of code, is starting by the basic shell of your code with a simple prompt and then adding small pieces one by one.

## Writing CI pipelines

*Copilot will help you in writing your pipeline definition files to generate the code for the different steps and tasks. Here are some examples of what it can do:*

- *generate a pipeline definition file `from scratch`*
- *accelerate the writing of a pipeline definition file by `generating the code` for the different `steps, tasks and pieces of script`*
- *help `discover marketplace tasks and extensions` that match your need*

### Step 1: generate from scratch

- Create a new file `pipeline.yml` in the `.github/workflows` folder of the project and start typing the following prompt:

```yml
# Github Action pipeline that runs on push to main branch
# Docker build and push the album-api image to ACR
```

*Copilot will generate the pipeline block by block. Generation pipelines Yaml, you will sometimes need to jump to a new line to trigger the generation of the next block more often than with other type of code.*

*It will often generate a task with a few errores coming from bad indentation or missing quote around a task name. You can easily fix these with your IDE and your developer skills :)*

### Step 2: add tasks from prompts

- You probably have a github action workflow with at least a "login" task to your container registry and a "docker build and deploy" task. Add a new comment after those tasks to tag the docker image with the github run id and push it to the registry:

```yml
# tag the image with the github run id and push to docker hub
```

you can play with other prompts like:

```yml
# run tests on the album-api image

# deploy the album-api image to the dev AKS cluster
```

### Step 3: add scripts from prompts

- Copilot is also very usefull when you need to write custom script like the following example:

```yml
# find and replace the %%VERSION%% by the github action run id in every appmanifest.yml file
```

## Infra As Code

Copilot can also help you write Infrastructure as code. It can generate code for `Terraform, ARM, Bicep, Pulumi, etc...` and also `Kubernetes manifest files`.

### Bicep

Open the `main.bicep`file in `iac/bicep` folder and start typing prompts at the end of the file to add new resources:

```js
// Container Registry

// Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision resource
```

### Terraform

Open the `app.tf`file in `iac/terraform` folder and start typing prompts at the end of the file to add new resources:

```yml
# Container Registry

# Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision resource
```

## Generate Git Commit comment

Yes, writing a comment should be mandatory and developers tend to be lazy. GitHub Copilot can help with that.

1. Just edit any file by adding some relevant content into it.

2. On the Git commit panel, click the small magical button on the right

# Multiple languages 

Let's put into practice what we have learned in a sample exercice.

First, create a new java file and paste the following code:

```java
public class ToolBox {

    static int totalCost(int mask, int pos, int n, int[][] cost) {

        if (mask == (1 << n) - 1) {
            return cost[pos][0];
        }

        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) == 0) {
                int nextCost = cost[pos][i] + totalCost(mask | (1 << i), i, n, cost);
                ans = Math.min(ans, nextCost);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    static int tsp(int[][] cost) {
        int n = cost.length;
        return totalCost(1, 0, n, cost);
    }
}
```

This code has been implemented by a colleague long ago, who happen to dislike leaving comments. But now you need to migrate it in Python.

<summary>Solution</summary>

This code tackles the infamous [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
It takes a matrix of distance between cities in input and returns the shortest path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
For example, if the input is the following matrix:

```java
int[][] cost = {
  //            Paris,  London,   Berlin,   Rome
  /* Paris */   {0,       10,       15,       20},
  /* London */  {10,      0,        35,       25},
  /* Berlin */  {15,      35,       0,        30},
  /* Rome */    {20,      25,       30,       0}
};
```

The output will be `80`, which is the shortest path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

| Paris | => | London | => | Rome | => | Berlin | => | Paris |
|-------|----|--------|----|------|----|--------|----|-------|
|       | 10 |        | 25 |      | 30 |        | 15 |       |

This is the naive, brute-force implementation.

# Extensibility and Preview Features

## Create custom copilot instructions

<div class="warning" data-title="Important">

> Custom Copilot Instruction aren't yet available in IntelliJ IDEA. The instructions won't be taken into account with this IDE.

</div>

<div class="info" data-title="Preview">

> The Copilot instructions file is a Public Preview feature (02/2025)

</div>

[Copilot intructions](https://copilot-instructions.md/) are a way to tailor Copilot Response to a specific project. 

To illustrate this, create a `.github/instructions.md` file in your project and add the following content:

```md
We use Bazel for managing our Java dependencies, not Maven, so when talking about Java packages, always give me instructions and code samples that use Bazel.

We always write JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses include JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

Our team uses Jira for tracking items of work.
```

This example provides Copilot with information about the whole project. These instructions will always be talen into account when a developer will ask Copilot for help.

In the example above, Copilot will **always** know that the project uses Bazel for managing Java dependencies, JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, and Jira for tracking items of work.


## Copilot Agents

Copilot agents are specialized tools within Copilot Extensions that integrate with Copilot Chat to offer tailored functionalities. They can perform tasks like querying documentation, retrieving data, executing actions, and providing AI-assisted coding suggestions. These agents enhance GitHub Copilot by enabling developers to build and integrate custom features into the Copilot Chat interface. To use a Copilot agent in Copilot Chat, it must be linked to a GitHub App.

More informations can be found here: [Copilot Agents][copilot-agent]


## Copilot Skillset

A skill in GitHub Copilot is a tool that the model uses to perform a specific task based on a user query. A skillset is a group of these skills (up to five per skillset). GitHub Copilot skillsets simplify the process of extending Copilotâ€™s functionality, enabling developers to integrate external services or custom API endpoints into their Copilot workflow. With skillsets, developers can have Copilot perform tasks like retrieving data or executing actions in third-party services without managing complex workflows or architecture. You can imagine a skillset that will retreive the latest informations of a specific Jira ticket, or a skillset that will create Lorem Ipsum text.

More informations can be found here: [Copilot Skillsets][copilot-skillset]

## When to Choose Agents and Skillsets

Choose Skillsets Skillsets when you want to:

- Quickly integrate existing APIs or services without handling AI logic
- Concentrate solely on the core functionality of your service
- Ensure consistent Copilot-style interactions with minimal development effort
- Begin with minimal infrastructure and setup

Use agents instead if you need:

- Complex and custom interaction flows
- Control over specific LLM models (using LLMs not provided by the Copilot API)
- Crafting custom prompts
- Advanced state management

You can find an example of the implementation of a Skillset in this [GitHub repository][copilot-skillset-repo-sample].
